**This Repo is not required**

As this repo code is integrated with ansible code based https://github.com/116davinder/zookeeper-cluster-ansible/blob/master/roles/customMetricExporter/files/zooki.py.

It is very hard for me to update at two different repos.

# Zooki
Apache Zookeeper Metric Collector

Usage: `python3 zooki.py /zookeeper /zookeeper/zookeeper-logs/ dev-env-zookeeper`


        <python version> <script path> <Zookeeper Storage Partition> <Metric Output Folder with slash> <cluster environment name>
